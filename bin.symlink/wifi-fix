# The purpose of this program script is to find the default gateway
# and continuously ping it every 15 seconds, in order to workaround
# Apple's BUG in their Wifi (AES) framework/driver, where Wifi
# connectivity is lost without continuous packet exchange.
#
# This BUG has been persistent in iOS 6 onward. It was also introduced
# with release of MacOS Mavericks 10.9.x.
#
# Reference: https://discussions.apple.com/message/24119041#24119041

# Find out IPv4 default gateway in route table.
gw=`netstat -rnfinet | grep default | awk '{print $2}'`

# If not found in route table, print message and exit.
test -z "${gw}" && echo "No (default) Gateway found." && exit 1

# ping the gateway every 15 seconds
ping -i 15 ${gw} > /dev/null
